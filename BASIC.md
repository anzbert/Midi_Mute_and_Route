# Midi Mute - Basic Version

## What does it do?

A Reaktor Plugin which lets all incoming Audio pass through unless it receives a Midi Note, in which case it mutes the Sound on the main Output Bus of this plugin. Primarily made for Maschine, but it can still be used in any other project.

This is the Basic Version of the Midi Mute&Route plugin without routing capabilities.

## Usage on Maschine

Load Midi Mute&Route onto a pad and route audio to it from any other sound or group. You can then play the pad with the plugin to mute the routed audio.

Mutes can easily be recorded onto a midi pattern or a clip just like any other instrument.

## Settings

Choose the Midi Note which triggers the Mute function. The default note is 60, or C3, which is the default Note sent by any Pad in Pads mode on Maschine. (Default: 60 / C3)

The Attack time of the mute and unmute can be set in milliseconds. Turn lower for a faster reaction time and higher if clicks are audible. (Default: 3 ms)

The plugin function can be reversed with the Invert switch. (Default: Off)

## Maschine +

Maschine Plus standalone compatible. Just copy to the SD card to this folder:

/Native Instruments/User Content/Reaktor/Ensembles/

## Feedback and Development

Feedback is appreciated. I am happy to add useful functions and fix bugs. I am still working on the optimal workflow for this plugin and I may change the available routing options in future releases.
